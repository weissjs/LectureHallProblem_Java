potential assignments between courses and lecture halls in the
format below:

  – The number of courses, N, in the first line. N>=3, N<=100
  – The number of lecture halls, M, in the second line. M>=3, M<=100
  – Each of the next N lines shows the possible assignments of each course
    to the existing lecture halls

• You can assume that there will be at most min(20, M) possible lecture halls
for each course
